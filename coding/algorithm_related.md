# Recursion:
 1. what is the simplest possible input ? the base case?
 2. play around with example and visualize, and try to see what their relationship is 
 3. relate hard cases to simpler cases (finding rls), how does the previous example relate to the next one 
 4. generalize the pattern
 5. write code by combining recursive pattern with base case

## Backtracking

### what is it ?
backtracking is an algorithmic approach that is used to build candidates for the solutions and abandon a canadidate when we determine that candidate can not be possible.  

### properties
- exhaustive solutions 

### general approach
